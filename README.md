# The ASTRES Toolbox for Mode Extraction of Non-Stationary Multicomponent Signals

## Synopsis

This project offers a set of Matlab functions for non-stationary multicomponent signal processing.
A formal and detailed description of the implemented methods is provided by the scientific paper [1].

Non-Stationary Multicomponent Signals. Proc. 25th European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO'17). Kos, Greece. Aug. 2017.

## Code Example

The figures produced in [1] can be generated using:

*Fig1_Ligo_compare.m*\\
 
*Fig2_cello.m*

## Motivation

This toolbox is proposed with the sake of reproducible research.
Anyone can reuse and modify this software for academic purposes only.

## API Reference

A detailed documentation will be available soon.
